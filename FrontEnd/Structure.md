#Structure#

The FrontEnd folder is almost entirely made up of folders and files generated by ember, to see the code itself, go inside "app"

The app is broken down into (All of the work inside app is ours)

###Adapters###
How the app talks to the API.

###Components###
Javascript files that interact with hbs files in templates/components.

###Controllers###
Files that decorate components or templates if they have JavaScript needs. 

###Helpers###
Files that help pretty up code by making you less redundant.

###Models###
Files that help describe data incoming from the API.

###Routes###
Files that control the flow of data and views in the program.

###Styles###
The main control of the aesthetics of the application

###Templates###
The main pages of the application
